# Sequenced Async Coroutine Example

Towards a basic C++20 core example for a sequenced async coroutines.


## Why?

This website tries to come up with a basis sequenced async coroutine example
we all can use to learn and teach.

  based on initial code I presented in my ACCU 2020 C++20 tutorial


**Phil Nash and Nico Josuttis (me)** came up with a first example in a joined evening session at ACCU 2020:

  Here, we especially tried to understand what's going on by placing several log statements

**Micha Eiler** came up with an incredible well explained example using all new C++20 features:
